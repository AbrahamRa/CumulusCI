``cumulusci.yml`` Structure
---------------------------
There are five top level sections of the ``cumulusci.yml`` file:

Project
*****************
The project section is largely generated by running ``cci project init`` and has two major sub-categories: ``package``, and ``git``.
The ``package`` sub-section contains information about the projects package, while the ``git`` sub-section contains a link to the projects GitHub repository, and branch prefixes.

Tasks
*****************

Flows
*****************

Services

Overrides
---------
Overrides are the most common form of configuration that can be done in the ``cumumulusci.yml`` file.
The following examples demonstrate various ways in which you can utilize overrides.

Add a Custom Task
********************************
If you've `written a custom task in python <TODO>` then you will need to add it to your ``cumulusci.yml`` file in order to make it visible to CumulusCI.

Override Scopes

When we reference ``cumulusci.yml`` in our documentation, we are referring to the ``cumulusci.yml`` file located in your project's root directory.
In actuality, CumulusCI merges multiple `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_ files that allow for CumulusCI to be configured at several distinct levels. 
All of thes files are have the same name- ``cumulusci.yml`` -but live in different locations on the file system.


Global Overrides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**File Path:** ``~/.cumulusci/cumulusci.yml``

Configuration of this file will override behavior across *all* CumulusCI projects on your machine. 

Project Overrides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**File Path:** ``/path/to/project/cumulusci.yml``

This ``cumulusci.yml`` file lives in the root directory of your project (typically a github repository too).
Configuration made here applies specifically to this project.
Changes to this file can be commited back to a remote repository so other team members can benefit from these customizations.

Local Project Overrides 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**File Path:** ``/path/to/project/cumulusci.yml``

Configurations made to this ``cumulusci.yml`` file apply to only the project with the given <project_name>.
If you want to make customizations to a project, but don't need them to be available to other team members, you would make those customizations here.

One Last ``cumulusci.yml``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is one more configuration file that exists; the internal ``cumulusci.yml`` file that ships with CumulusCI itself.
This `master cumulusci.yml <>` file, contains all of the standard tasks, flows, and default configurations that come out of the box with CumulusCI.
