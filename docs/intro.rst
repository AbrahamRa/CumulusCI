Introduction
============

CumulusCI helps teams build great applications on the Salesforce platform by automating org setup, testing, and deployment.

**Best practices, proven at scale.** CumulusCI provides a complete development and release process created by Salesforce.org to build and release applications to thousands of users on the Salesforce platform. It's easy to start with the default tasks (single actions) and flows (sequences of actions), or customize by adding your own.

**Batteries included.** Out-of-the-box features help you quickly:

* Build sophisticated orgs with automatic installation of dependencies.
* Load and capture sample datasets to make your orgs feel real.
* Apply transformations to existing metadata to tailor orgs to your specific requirements.
* Run builds in continuous integration systems.
* Create end-to-end browser tests and setup automation using `Robot Framework <https://robotframework.org/>`_.

**Build anywhere.** Automation defined using CumulusCI is portable. It is stored in a source repository and can be run from your local command line, from a continuous integration system, or from a customer-facing installer. CumulusCI can run automation on scratch orgs created using the Salesforce CLI, or on persistent orgs like sandboxes, production orgs, and Developer Edition orgs.

**Build for anyone.** Automation defined using CumulusCI can support all roles working on a project:

* *Developers* can create new development environments for different feature branches.
* *QAs* can create test environments from feature branches and managed package installs.
* *Doc writers* can create environments to interact with new features and capture screenshots to prepare documentation.
* *Product managers* can create environments to interact with new features and provide feedback on future work.
* *Release engineers* can create beta and final releases and push them to subscriber orgs.
* *Partners* can create their own project which builds on top of your package.
* *Customers* can install the product and get set up using the same automation steps used during development and QA.
