MetaCI
------
The Salesforce.org release engineering team, which built CumulusCI, also maintains a CI system called `MetaCI <https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/MetaCI>`_.
MetaCI is an open source app built to run on Heroku, and is designed specifically to work with CumulusCI and Salesforce.
However, MetaCI is a bit complicated to set up and operate, so this recipe aims to provide a simpler alternative that can work fine in many cases.
For additional information on MetaCI visit the `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/MetaCI>`_.
