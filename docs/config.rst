Configuring CumulusCI
=====================

The ``cumulusci.yml`` File(s)
-----------------------------
For the vast majority of cases in our documentation, when we reference ``cumulusci.yml``, we are referring to the ``cumulusci.yml`` file located in your project's root directory.
In actuality, CumulusCI synthesizes multiple `YAML <https://yaml.org/>`_ files that allow for CumulusCI to be configured at several distinct levels. 
All of thes files are have the same name- ``cumulusci.yml`` -but live in different locations on the file system. 

Global Overrides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**File Path:** ``~/.cumulusci/cumulusci.yml``

Configuration of this file will override behavior across *all* CumulusCI projects. 
TODO: Example

Project Overrides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**File Path:** ``~/.cumulusci/<project_name>/cumulusci.yml``

This ``cumulusci.yml`` file lives in the root directory of your project (typically a github repository too).
Configuration made here applies specifically to this project.
Changes to this file can be commited back to a remote repository so other team members can benefit from these customizations.
For example, maybe your project has a set of sObject records that need to be inserted after package installation.
e default ``dev_org`` flow 

Local Project Overrides 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**File Path:** ``path/to/<project_name>/cumulusci.yml``

Configurations made to this ``cumulusci.yml`` file apply to only the project with the given <project_name>.
If you want to make customizations to a project, but don't need them to be available to other team members, you would make those customizations here.

One Last ``cumulusci.yml``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is one more configuration file that exists; the internal ``cumulusci.yml`` file that ships with CumulusCI itself.
This master ``cumulusci.yml`` file, contains all of the standard tasks, flows, and configurations that are available out of the box with CumulusCI.
